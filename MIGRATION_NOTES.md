   - Updated to use Next.js `Link` component instead of React Router
   - Added `'use client'` directive for client-side functionality

2. **Pages**
   - `Home.tsx` → `app/page.tsx` (root page)
   - `cashapp.tsx` → `app/cashapp/page.tsx`
   - `crypto.tsx` → `app/crypto/page.tsx`
   - All pages updated to use Next.js app router structure
   - Added `'use client'` directive for client-side state management

3. **API Routes**
   - `api/send-email.ts` → `app/api/send-email/route.ts`
   - Updated to use Next.js 13+ App Router API format
   - Converted from Vercel serverless function to Next.js route handler

4. **Styling**
   - Updated `app/globals.css` with the matrix-style theme from the old app
   - Maintained the terminal/hacker aesthetic with green colors and monospace fonts

5. **Dependencies**
   - Resend dependency already present in package.json
   - All necessary Next.js dependencies included

### 🔄 Next Steps (Manual)

1. **Template Files**
   - Move `mailsperm-old/templates/cashapp-template.ts` to `templates/`
   - Move `mailsperm-old/templates/crypto-template.ts` to `templates/`
   - Update imports in `app/cashapp/page.tsx` and `app/crypto/page.tsx` to use the templates

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Set up `RESEND_API_KEY` in your environment variables

3. **Testing**
   - Run `npm run dev` to test the application
   - Verify all routes work: `/`, `/cashapp`, `/crypto`
   - Test email sending functionality
